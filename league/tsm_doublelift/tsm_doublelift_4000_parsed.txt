Was mostly trauma too 
and drug seekers 
did you ever get compassion fatigue @BlondeSquirrel ? 
i usually work at psychosis 
wats compassion fatigue 
I only lost composure twice and I was a student at the University of Florida teaching hospital 
@Brumpooo it's pretty much when you feel indifference to what you do i think 
LUL 
One was a little girl in the burn unit wrapped head to toe cause she had first degree burns over 75% of her body 
oh alright thanks bud 
i have a friend that does shelter work and she had to change fields bc she felt super worn down 
The other was two seniors in high school left campus for lunch and got hit by a dump truck 
oh geez 
rekt 
rip 
LUL 
jayce so fair tbh 
I was called in on the first one and they called her then I had to go x-ray the other and she kept asking me how her friend was 
it's kinda fun to work with psychosis people (i don't really know the real term lol)

@eirikachu You get some stories. Most ERs have a mental health room, or the room that only opens from the outside 
@Tumirnix, PogChamp 
@Brumpooo does your school have career counselors?

My favorite story was we had a frequent flyer drug seeker come in and the doc on duty would not give her anything but Motrin 500 
@eirikachu, i go to a university but im just a freshman and i cant be admitted into labs or anything till my next year 
lol motrin kbalorFAIL 
She got mad and tried to run through the double ER doors but they only open if you hit the button 
@Brumpooo weird at my uni we had counselors that could kind of give us a general career path 
Here some drug seeker came to hospital with knife and wanted suboxone lol 
We tried to warn her but she hit them at a full run was funny as *** 
ouch 
even though I had to do nasal bone x-rays on her after 
@BlondeSquirrel, So it looked like NA trying to win world's? 
@eirikachu, i honestly have no idea wat is available at my school theres just so much 
Doublelift what do u think of the botrk and guinsoo buffs on pbe
